	* include/blockfs_utils.h : Put necessary the parenthesis around
	the caching macros. The absence of parenthesis was causing the
	caching problems.

	* src/utils.c (get_size): Cleaned up some error messages
	(blockfs_calc_and_store_sizes): Changed the size computations so
	that they now round down rather than round up. As a result, we can
	now successfully create and use an ext2 filesystem on a blockfs
	volume.

	* src/read.c: Re-wrote the read module so that it now works
	without the assumption that the read offsets will be on block
	boundaries, and that the read size will be multiples of the block
	size.

	* include/blockfs.h : Added the CACHE_SLOT_NUM macro.

	* src/read.c : Updated variable name cache_block_num to
	cache_slot_num to make the code more comprehensible. Updated the
	code to make use of the new address translation macros.

	* src/write.c: Implemented the write module

	* src/read.c: Commented out locking code as it has been decided to
	ignore synchronization issues for the time being.

	* include/blockfs_locks.h: Cleaned up the comments.

	* src/read.c (update_block): Removed the magic numbers and used the 
	new tunable macros wherever relevant.

	* include/blockfs.h: Added macros to serve as tunables to the
	caching algorithm.

	* src/read.c: Cleaned up the comments a bit.
